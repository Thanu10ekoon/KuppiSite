   - Created utilities for testing environment variable configuration

## Deployment Checklist

### Server Deployment (Vercel)

- [ ] Ensure the following environment variables are set in Vercel:
  - [ ] `MONGODB_URI` - Correctly formatted MongoDB connection string
  - [ ] `JWT_SECRET` - Secure secret for JWT token generation
  - [ ] `JWT_EXPIRE` - Token expiration time (e.g., "30d")
  - [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` - Comma-separated list of allowed origins (include both kuppisite.vercel.app and kuppi-site.vercel.app)

- [ ] MongoDB Atlas Configuration:
  - [ ] Add `0.0.0.0/0` to IP whitelist to allow connections from Vercel
  - [ ] Ensure database user has correct permissions

### Client Deployment (Vercel)

- [ ] Environment Variables:
  - [ ] `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` - Server URL including /api path (e.g., https://kuppisite.vercel.app/api)

- [ ] Test after deployment:
  - [ ] Visit the `/debug` page to check connectivity
  - [ ] Test registration flow
  - [ ] Test login flow
  - [ ] Test video access

## Local Development with Vercel Backend

To run the frontend locally while connecting to the Vercel backend:

1. Run: `npm run dev:vercel` in the client directory
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/debug` to verify connectivity

## Diagnosis Tools

1. MongoDB Connection Test:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run test:mongodb
   ```

2. API Connection Debugging:
   - Visit `/debug` route in the frontend
   - Use the API Connection Test component

## Final Steps

After deploying both client and server on Vercel:

1. Check server logs in Vercel dashboard for any connection issues
2. Visit client app and navigate to `/debug` to verify API connectivity
3. Test login functionality with valid credentials
4. If issues persist, refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING.md document
