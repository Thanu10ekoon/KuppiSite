   - Improved client error display

3. **Added Diagnostic Tools:**
   - Created `test-mongodb-connection.js` for quick connection testing

## How to Test

1. Run the MongoDB connection test:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run test:mongodb
   ```

2. Test the Vercel deployment simulator:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run test:vercel
   ```

3. After deploying, visit `/debug` in the client app to verify connectivity

## Important Environment Variable

The `MONGODB_URI` must be formatted correctly and include the database name:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## MongoDB Atlas Configuration

Make sure to add `0.0.0.0/0` to the IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas to allow connections from Vercel.
