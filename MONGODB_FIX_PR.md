# MongoDB Connection Fix for Vercel Deployment

This PR addresses the MongoDB connection issues in the Vercel deployment, particularly the "Operation `users.findOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms" error that causes 500 errors when attempting to log in via the debug page.

## Changes

1. **Enhanced MongoDB Connection Settings:**
   - Increased serverSelectionTimeoutMS from 5000ms to 30000ms
   - Increased socketTimeoutMS from 45000ms to 60000ms
   - Added connectTimeoutMS, heartbeatFrequencyMS, and other connection options
   - Implemented connection retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Added event listeners for reconnection on error

2. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Enhanced error handling in auth controllers for MongoDB timeout errors
   - Added detailed error logging for database operations
   - Created a User.findByEmailWithRetry static method with automatic retry logic
   - Updated client side to display more helpful messages for database timeouts

3. **Added Database Status Tools:**
   - Created a new `/api/db/status` endpoint to check database connection status
   - Updated the APIDebugger component to test database connectivity
   - Created `verify-mongodb-deployment.js` script for testing deployed environment
   - Added a `verify-mongodb.bat` helper script for Windows users

4. **Documentation:**
   - Updated MONGODB_ATLAS_CONFIG.md with detailed setup instructions
   - Enhanced debug logging throughout the application
   - Added comprehensive console logging for connection events

## How to Test

1. Run the MongoDB connection test:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node test-mongodb-connection.js
   ```

2. Test the verification script:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node verify-mongodb-deployment.js
   ```

3. Or use the Windows helper script:
   ```
   verify-mongodb.bat
   ```

4. After deploying, visit `/debug` in the client app to verify connectivity

## Technical Details

### MongoDB Connection Options

```javascript
// Enhanced options for MongoDB Atlas connections
{
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 30000, // Increased from 5000ms
  socketTimeoutMS: 60000,         // Increased from 45000ms
  connectTimeoutMS: 30000,        // Added connection timeout
  heartbeatFrequencyMS: 10000,    // Added regular heartbeat checks
  retryWrites: true,              // Enable retry for write operations
  retryReads: true,               // Enable retry for read operations
  w: 'majority',                  // Write concern for data durability
  maxPoolSize: 10,                // Control connection pool size
  minPoolSize: 1                  // Maintain at least one connection
}
```

### Retry Logic

The application now includes automatic retry logic for:
1. Initial database connection (with exponential backoff)
2. User lookup operations during login
3. Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## MongoDB Atlas Configuration

Make sure to add `0.0.0.0/0` to the IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas to allow connections from Vercel.
